# victor

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of victor is to interact with the [Mapbox Vector Tile
API](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/vector-tiles-api/) ( [also
here](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#vector-tiles) ) in R. Grab a
vector tile, work with it using the simple features package sf. Plot
static maps with ggplot2, tmap, etc.

A [Mapbox Access Token](link%20here) is required to access the API. See
these instructions … link to mapdeck instructions?

Inspired and fuelled by:

  - mapdeck
  - protolite
  - ceramic
  - slippymath
  - rmapzen
  - sf
